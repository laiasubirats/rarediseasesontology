Éloïse;30;France;0;0;;10;Tracheotomy;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Éloïse is a 30-year-old girl from France who has a rare disease that was detected in 1996. This disease has many consequences. She was so thoroughly operated that her larynx was very damaged. She has a tracheotomy for 2 years, which complicates a little her daily life. And since her illness has changed a little, she made the choice to have a recognition of handicapped worker. We all search on the internet, we find everything and anything. Her first thought was to use the Rare Diseases Forum, which gives a more official, more serious side of the testimony. It makes people want to trust this site by its referencing precisely of rare diseases. I use this forum to testify and it is a support.;0.17847222222222223;0.5416666666666667
David;35;Sierra Leone;0;0;Monkeypox;;;;;4;4;4;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;David is a 35-year-old man from Sierra Leone who suffers from monkeypox. Monkeypox is a rare viral disease seen in the rain forests of Central and West Africa. It is transmitted to people primarily by infected animals, including squirrels, rats, mice and monkeys, with limited transmission between humans. Nonetheless, careful monitoring continues in the affected community, including 13 people known to be in close contact with the patient but who remain without symptoms. Those symptoms include fever, muscle aches and swollen lymph nodes, followed by a skin rash. They can normally be treated – monkeypox has a fatality rate of between 1 and 10 percent. After being treated by “barrier nursing,” he is being recognized as the country’s third known occurrence of the disease since 1970. David knows very little about his disease, does not work and feels a little bit lonely and uninformed. ;-0.0411525974025974;0.5448051948051948

Rob;;;0;0;None;;None;Rare Diseases;;0;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;You arrive the night before the training. It’s dark but the trees are bright green, the horses are so comfortable, they lay down in the pasture sleeping, and the cabins scattered thoroughout the grounds emit a warm glow. You sleep well in the Irish night as fresh air fills you. You’ve come to Barretstown in Ballymore Eustace, Ireland to participate as a volunteer at an eight day camp summer session. 120 kids from 7 countries will arrive in two days. They all share the common experience of living with a serious medical condition at a young age. Before the campers arrive, there is a full day of training for all the volunteers. A full Irish breakfast starts the mornings off right. The overwhelming spirit is of support, preparation, curiosity and laughter. The day begins with a discussion about therapeutic recreation, the core philosophy behind Barretstown’s summer camp programme. The campers finally arrive. Everyone is excited, full of questions, and eager for the days ahead. The language barrier across the different nationalities melts away with volunteer translators and careful planning by the programme staff. Days go quickly and are structured with two activity periods in the morning and two in the afternoon with camp wide activities after dinner. The vast selection includes: canoeing, fishing, arts and crafts, high ropes, horses, photography, theatre, and music. Simply, it is a place of first names, high fives, smiles, and encouragement. The doctor visits, difficult treatments, and discomfort at school are replaced with one thing: FUN. Fun and challenge is discovered by each individual in their own unique way. We all have different levels of comfort. Some of the most confidence developing experiences can be witnessed when the camper comes down from the High Ropes course or off the back of a gentle horse. Rebuilding is going on, and a volunteer is in a privileged position to be a part of it. The effect of attending a camp like Barretstown has a lifelong impact.;0.11987449243263196;0.5416426725729051
Elysha;15;;0;0;Malignant neoplasms of eye, brain and other parts of central nervous system;4;Chemotherapy;;;;;0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"My name is Elysha Ni Chulain. I am 15 years old. My story starts in 2001. I was four; I had a problem with my vision. My left eye was getting weaker and weaker. I had to wear an eye patch and glasses. Every morning I would pick out a cartoon figure sticker, usually a Disney princess, and Mum would put it on my patch. I kind of looked like a pirate not a princess! I hated wearing that patch. It was very uncomfortable. The glasses didn’t work either. I used to chew on everything: tables, chairs, books. I got into trouble with the library because I ate a book once. This brings a new meaning to the phrase bookworm, lol . When I was five, I was diagnosed with a brain tumour on my optic nerve, right in the middle of my brain. It was inoperable. That means you can’t have an operation to take it away. So I had to start chemotherapy. I have spent the past decade fighting this disease, putting up with endless tests and lengthy hospital admissions, enduring many bouts of chemotherapy and several major operations. On my first day in St John’s Ward in Crumlin, I met my oncologist and my neurosurgeon. I remember thinking that everybody was lovely – the nurses were so nice. All the kids had no hair and were very pale. I had surgery the next day to have my broviac line put in. This is a white tube that goes in to my main vein just above where my heart is. All my meds, chemo, infusions and transfusions went through this. I would like to say I was always brave and most of the time I was, but there were times when I was so ill I wanted to give up. I was just so tired but Mum would always say,  You have the best doctors, the best medicine, but you have to do your part too, you have to fight it. She always pushed me on. Last summer I went to Barretstown and it was brilliant. We didn’t just sit around being sick, we just had nonstop fun. I made loads of friends from different countries and even though we didn’t speak the same language, we understood each other because we have all gone through the same thing. When I was sick I lost my confidence because I missed out on doing normal things. My time in Barretstown gave that back to me. I got to do things I never thought I would be able to do. I felt more at ease, I was able to open up, to let go and just have fun. Every night I went to bed with a smile on my face, exhausted from doing lots of crazy, fun things during the day. Having cancer turned out to be a really good thing as I got to go to Barretstown and will return there when I’m older to work as a Cara and give back what it gave me – smiles. As my mum said, the chemo may deal with the physicality of cancer, but cancer leaves very deep, hidden scars and that’s where Barretstown comes into its full power.

Ella;5;;0;0;Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia;3;;;;;;0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Ella got a temperature just before Christmas, and started limping with pains in her leg, until eventually she stopped walking altogether as it was too painful. We knew something was wrong and on our fourth visit to hospital we were told to go to Crumlin where she was diagnosed with leukaemia on 2nd January, 2010. Our whole world stopped and life as we knew it was suddenly no longer.Her leukaemia was categorised as high risk which meant a year of intense chemotherapy, meaning we were in Crumlin probably 5 days a week for her to receive treatment. We were constantly watching what we were doing and thinking ahead, deciding well we can’t go there or we can’t do this as a family as one of us had to stay at home with Ella and one would go with the other children. Then in October we went to Barretstown when Ella was 10 months into treatment. We were going down to Barretstown really more for our other three children at that point because all six of us hadn’t been anywhere together during that time. We didn’t really know what to expect, but we were all excited going and when we got there on the first day everyone made such a fuss of welcoming us that we knew immediately that it was a very special place. The major thing for Ella that weekend was we hadn’t let her out of our sight since she was diagnosed. Nobody else had minded her, nobody had looked after her, nobody like grannies, granddads. Ella was always with my husband or me. However when we were going to activities on Saturday morning (we knew that the boys would be going into group activities) I didn’t realise that Ella would get to go off on her own as well. She was put in her little line and went off in her group and not a bother to her, she was delighted to be going off, she felt this is my little group. She gave a smile and gave us a little wave and I think it did her the world of good to be able to go off on her own and play with little kids her own age which she hadn’t had a chance to do because she had been in a bubble at home for 10 months. Ella’s three brothers (Harry, Jack and Michael) also went to sibling camp in Barretstown for a week during the summer. They made great friends with children from all over Europe and although they don’t go to camp and talk about their sick brothers and sisters they understand that they have sick brothers and sisters and they know that Barretstown is a special place for them to go to, that they’ve had a tough time too and life has been hard for them as well. Barretstown got us rid of all our bad memories from when Ella was sick and made us forget about it, even for me and my husband, even if we only forgot about it for that weekend when we were down there because it is a little bubble you’re in down there, it’s a little world of its own, that you do forget about everything else that’s going on outside and you just have fun and laugh and really you need that laughter when everything else is so tough! When your child is diagnosed with a serious illness your whole life revolves around hospitals. Everything else in life is put on the back burner. But when you go to Barretstown, you meet other families who are going through what you’re going through. Ella loved being the centre of attention and getting up on that stage in the dining hall and singing and dancing after every meal, she just loved that. She’d sing the songs for weeks on end afterwards and she loved dressing up and putting on little shows, and meeting little friends, you know, normal stuff that children probably would do but hadn’t been a part of her life for a long time. ;0.05807341269841271;0.5491785714285714
Mohammad;10;Iran;0;1;Multiple system atrophy, cerebellar type;5;;;;;;;;3;;;;;;;;;;;;;He lived normally and he didn’t have any problems till the age of 5. One day when he was playing in the yard in his grandmother’s house he fainted suddenly. His mother cuddled him and kept calling his name Mohammad and that was the beginning of their new life. The story of a boy who just opens his eyes by his mother’s voice There is a boy lives in the vicinity of Karaj, he is not waiting to be off from school because of polluted air since he slept on his bed with an oxygen tube and his eyes just open by mother’s voice. The mother’s name is Zahra and she welcomed us in their small house. Their house had a room where designed for Mohammad. She gave us warm and friendly reception then talked bout Mohammad disease and her patience and making efforts to keep him alive. he was healthy like other children until age 4, one day when he was playing he lost his balance and fell down on the ground, at first I thought he fainted since he was exhausted, but when his eyes had changed I said he is dead and shouted continually My son has gone when my father came home and saw Mohammad he said that he had a seizure. Zahra and her family were hopeful and took him to the hospital. After hospitalizing him and initial examinations, the doctor said he had a seizure and he didn’t have a serious problem. Zahra explained that previously he had a cold and he consumed Diphenhydramine and the other drug simultaneously and it caused the underlying disease becomes active. After one week from his seizure although, he was a bit lethargic he was like an ordinary child. Next week, he had a seizure again and this time it was associated with fever. A doctor diagnosed his disease as Autism and they started his treatment but later it was detected that he is not suffering from Autism. Some time has passed since his last seizure, he didn’t have any problems and it was thought to be improving but it wasn’t. After a while, lack of balance increased in Mohammad and he lost his walking power. His doctor changed his drugs as he observed this changes, but before using the new drug again he had a seizure and taken to the hospital. After hospitalizing for hours, he got well and the doctor permitted to go home, while his mother repeated continually that he had a seizure without any especial reasons. Mohammad discharged from hospital and returned home, it was 11:00 o’clock at night, he had a seizure again and taken to the hospital, the doctor didn’t let him go home and hospitalized him for taking more tests. His father had consulted with some doctors and the doctors sent his data to Germany and French for more investigations Then they announced that he is afflicted to cerebellar Atrophy. At the same time, the Iranian doctor said: he is affected by cerebellar Atrophy and just can live for two months. 1391 new year holidays was the worst time for Mohammad, his right lung got disabled, he had just one lung for breathing and his consciousness level was getting less day-to-day. Now he is 10 years old, his consciousness level is 4 and whenever his mother calls his name seems he comes back to life again. Zahra was a good kind of a devoted mother, she kept smiling when she was talking about her son. Although the expenses of the treatment are too high for them, she didn’t complain. She said heart fully: I know Mohammad never get cured. but I let the doctors test him to diagnose the reason of his disease in order to prevent other children from affecting. ;0.027697884771055496;0.41532291556681805
Abolfazl;11;Iran;0;1;Arthropathy in hypersensitivity reactions classified elsewhere;7;;;;;;;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP) is kind of rare disease which is less identified and unfortunately, it is not supported by any organizations as it is an orphan disease. Helping doesn’t depend on the number of help wanted. Purpura can affect anyone. But it’s most common in children especially boys between4 to 12. HSP is a disorder that causes inflammation and bleeding in the small blood vessels in skin, joints, intestines and kidneys. The most striking feature of HSP is a purplish rash, typically on the lower legs and buttocks. Purpura can also cause abdominal pain and aching joints. Rarely serious kidney damage can occur. There is a boy, his name is Abolfazl Jafari, he is 11 years old and he lives in Sari. He has affected by this disease since he was 7 years old. His mother says: one night he had a high fever, he faced bloody urine and vomited blood regularly. His disease is still not known with certainty and his family still doing tests to determine the status of their child’s condition and they bear a million costs. His father was a truck driver and paid a lot of money for his treatment and he sold his truck, to pay the cost of treatment. Abolfazl father during the last 3 years has paid 13 million Toman for the trial of his son. Every time they come to Tehran because of their child, they spend the whole night at the mosque in the hospital. His father says: My son was educating at primary school but because he is weak and sometimes he faints, vomits and they had to send him to the hospital regularly, he stopped going to school. Abolfazl mother and father say: We asked for financial support from the Ministry of Health, the Health Ministry said in response: We support the families of patients who are handicapped, and Your child has still not been disabled! also Mr. Yousefnezhad the representative of Sari at each visit says he will follow the case, but any small incident occurred. Relief Committee says they can not support us since we are not orphans. Right now only Mr. Davoudian General Manager of Rare Diseases Foundation of Iran and Mrs. Rafe head of Red Crescent volunteers to support us financially. I utmost appreciate Dr. Araiaie, Prof. Aghighi, Dr. Ghafari and Dr. Hooshmand because they always support my son in different ways. Fortunately, doctors help and never ask me to pay for examinations and we just pay for delivering the blood tests to Germany. The center for supporting specific diseases told us they only support patients with specific diseases and because your child’s disease is not registered as specific and it is kind of rare one we are not allowed to support you. “Indeed, if we are going to help anyone, it should be inclusive.” Is it pleasant? It’s better we help the small number of patients instead of waiting for them to increase, just that time we can feel proud.;0.10194179894179892;0.5076939356939356
Nazanin;1;Iran;0;1;Epidermolysis bullosa;0;;;;;;;;;;3;3;;;;;;;;;;"Enter by a smile. This is the first thing you see on the door when you want to enter Eb community room. You have to put off your shoes when you want to get in, to reduce the risk of patients getting ill. Entering the rectangle shape room, you can see men and women divided two sides of the room and the children by their mothers. Children with a lot of scars and blisters on their skins and some of them have stuck fingers because of the severity of their disease. The youngest member of this community is Nazanin Zahra with six months old, she is carried in a hand cradle and her parents who are relatives take a good care of her. Big blisters are seen all over her little body, her hands, legs and her face. She has also a respiratory problem as her lungs are affected, too. As her father says, she had been affected by Eb since her birth; it was just tipped red on her fingers and symptoms increased gradually. He complains of physicians and nurses treat to her daughter, they constantly sent them from one hospital to another, finally she hospitalized in one of them. Once when they wanted to take her blood for testing, her skin peeled and they delivered her to CCU. His father said they used my child as a sample because they haven’t seen such disease. Besides, he added how much he irritated by hospitals staff that he prefers never go there again and if her daughter gets sick he gives her an acetaminophen when she has an infection he gives her antibiotic instead of taking her to the hospital. He is a worker and he cannot afford the high expenses of drugs and treatment but he never neglects her daughter treatment. He earns 390 thousand toman and the cost of her drugs is 1 million toman, as he said EB community helps them partly. Masoumeh is another 3-year-old child who one of her eyes is brown and the other is blue because of EB. Her mother says there is a layer covered her left eye and it needs surgery and her eyes are healthy,it is said by her doctor. Her mother says one of her legs didn’t have skin and her foot thumb wasn’t completed at her birth time but after a while, they cured and got better. Her mother said they intend to do surgery on her eye, leg and hand but they cannot pay the cost. Her mother talks about her sleep since she has lots of scars on her body she cannot sleep well and her mother scratches her body all night long. She demands to set a special nursery room for these children to solve their problem. Another patient is Nazanin Zahra with 3 years old. Her mother studied about her disease very much and she talks like a doctor. She as well asks for setting up a special medical center for these children. For their oral treatment, they need to be anesthetized so they need facilities. Her mother adds, there is no specialty center for poisoned patient and once when they wanted to inject a serum to her, Nazanin’s vessel torn three times and the floor covered in her blood. She also complains of the high expenses of drugs and treatment for EB. She said each package of MEPILEX costs 11000 tomans and the number of packages we used depends on the weather because if the weather is hot and dry we have to use more MEPILEX. She urges officials pay more attention to patients affected by EB. Poor financial status is the common point in all these families stories. Ali Davoudian General Manager of Rare Diseases Foundation of Iran arrived after an hour. According to his words, a letter has been sent from the Presidency to Department of Housing and Urban Development in order to allocate a land 5000 meter to the foundation for establishing a special clinic for patients with EB. Moreover, he mentioned that the biggest problem of the families is providing bandage and the difficulty of washing the scars. Ultimately, he pointed to the fact that about 40 thousand people in the country affected by this disease and he suggested because attending public space is difficult to these patients, in one of the large hospitals in Tehran, such as Imam Khomeini (RA) or Labbafinejad, thousand meters of land devoted to patients with EB.

Pedro;38;Spain;1;0;Craniofacial dysostosis;0;Plastical surgery;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;First of all congratulate you for the new year and for this initiative that seems to me very important for those affected of any kind of disease or rarity and for their relatives. Some time ago, because my son Pedro is 38 years old, I was at the Peace Hospital in Madrid to report to the Plastic Surgery Service about a face intervention because he was born with aesthetic problems whose diagnosis is between Apple and Crouzon , And at that time could only be intervened in Paris (Dr. Tessier). Previously he had seen Dr. Tresserra of Barcelona and had recommended that he be seen by Dr. Tessier in Paris. The Head of the Department of Plastic Surgery instead of giving me the report recognizing that these interventions only succeeded in Paris in order to compensate a little the expenses caused by a transfer to the French capital and the substantial costs of this intervention (costs That I could have endured Social Security in Spain since I have been quoting all my life), he told me that it was similar to sending a son to study abroad to a luxury school, that here in Spain could be solved with the proper means. In those moments in Spain had not been recognized with some success with these interventions, therefore it does not occur to anyone to enter an operating room without the due possibilities of improvement. I already had enough with the problem of my eight year old son with three or four speeches in Seville without having his problem solved at all because it is a delicate subject such as the aesthetics of a whole different face. The Head of Service got away with it and I went to Paris with my son bearing the risk and expenses that can be imagined. The intervention in Paris was performed between four or five specialists and were ten hours in the operating room. Fortunately my son Pedro is in good health. It takes the best that it can be different from others and withstand from small the strange looks of the whole world that is found in the street. We have the defect of human beings to look with surprise on that which is different, and Peter is. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to communicate this episode of my life with Pedro. I know that you will understand that every situation lived in times of anxiety for problems of this type are a great mental and physical effort for the patient and family. My situation with Pedro has always been the two alone and that makes the situation more painful. Thanks again and you have me for what I can contribute.;0.10907342657342657;0.42903596403596395
Anonymous1;;Spain;1;0;Cerebral arteritis, not elsewhere classified;;;;;;;4;;;;;;3;;;;;;;;;I have recently been diagnosed with a rare disease, Susac Syndrome. Around 200 cases are known worldwide. It is a brain, retinal and auditory microangiopathy and affects mostly young women between 20 and 50 years. I have been suffering for over 2 years until finally I have been diagnosed. At first I started with a ringing in my ears, but I gave no importance. Within a few months I had some horrible dizziness associated with a sudden deafness in both ears. I was treated with corticoids. There have been sequelae of hearing loss at low frequencies. I was mistakenly diagnosed with a Meniere's Syndrome or Internal Ear Autoimmune Disease. After a few months suddenly my eye was very itchy and after a few days I noticed a stain on the eye, which has not yet gone. All this has been associated with an anxious depressive disorder. In the magnetic resonance small demyelinating lesions could be observed which led to the idea of ??possible sclerosis, but after a lumbar puncture was discarded. Now I have just been diagnosed with this disease and it seems that there is no specific treatment for it, so doctors are usually tested with immunosuppressants, aspirin and corticosteroids depending on how advanced the disease is. From here, I invite all people suffering from this disease, if any, to contact me to see if we all fight for research on this disease.;-0.05500000000000001;0.45791666666666664
Juanjo;25;Spain;1;0;Congenital malformation syndromes predominantly affecting facial appearance;0;;;;0;;0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Juanjo is 25 years old and suffers from Apert Syndrome, a rare disease that causes malformations on the face, skull, hands and feet. Despite all the difficulties he faces, Juanjo is an example of overcoming, fighting and optimism. What difficulties does a person have with this syndrome? First of all we suffer a lot of people's rejection. Sometimes, because of our illness, we are treated as rare bugs within society. Before this situation affected me a lot, but as a result of having more information about my pathology and meeting other people in my same situation I know that I am a boy like any other. Also we must take into account the medical aspect. A person with this pathology has to attend multiple consultations throughout his life. In Spain there are two reference hospitals, one in Madrid and one in Barcelona. For the affected and the families that do not live in these two cities the continuous transfers represent a disorder in the day to day. Is the economic aspect important? Yes, a person with Apert Syndrome needs to be treated by specialist doctors. Most of these professionals are in Madrid and Barcelona. Those affected who live in other cities have to travel to the centers of reference, which is an expense of the family economy. In addition, people who suffer from this syndrome, we have to undergo several operations throughout our life. When I was born the operation of the skull was worth a million and a half pesetas that the family had to pay. At present, social security pays for these operations. Despite the difficulties you have had, do you currently have a job? Yes, in 2009 the Councilor for Social Affairs of Aranjuez called me and offered me a job as a caretaker in a social center, and I am very proud of it. When you do something you have to like it, if you do it reluctantly 90% will go wrong. How have your parents taken the disease? My parents are very proud of my daily improvement. Sometimes, like when I come to Madrid alone or I go with my friends to the beach feel afraid. What worries them most is that they will overcome the barriers of everyday life. Do you propose new challenges, new barriers to jump? Yes, now I have the challenge of losing weight, I have signed up for an agency and I try to play sports, I like running and I have participated in the Madrid and Aranjuez marathon, I do not do it to win, but to try to reach the goal, With that I already won. Do you participate in the solidarity race organized by the FEDER every year? Yes, the ERDF career is wonderful, there the challenge is to reach everyone and every year there is more participation. I try to overcome the mark of the previous year, if I get it phenomenal. In addition to seeing that the country house is full of cars is great, because it is noticed that people are turned over with rare diseases. At birth doctors did not diagnose what disease you suffered. When did you know that you had Apert Syndrome? When I was born 25 years ago, nothing about my illness was known. I knew I had this disease at age 18 when I met my association through a newspaper story. From that changed my life and I got to know ERDF. What does ERDF mean to you? ERDF is my soul. It was a joy to know the federation, they help me a lot, and thanks to them I got to know Andrés Iniesta. We do Apert Syndrome round tables, we go to fairs, I support them, because if we remain silent we are not going anywhere, but if we move people see us. In addition, when I am asked to give papers and congresses about my illness in The Casa Encendida in Madrid, and I like it because I'm getting better every day. Do you have contact with people with rare diseases in other countries? If, and abroad rare diseases are worse, I through social networks contact people from Mexico, Colombia or Peru, who beg you how they can make a partnership in your country, which do not have state support. The operations have to pay for them, and there you stay blocked because you do not know what you can do for them. It is very hard. What would you say to parents with children with Apert Syndrome? That I would not mind having a child with Apert Syndrome, because it can give you grief, but above all great joy. I tell the parents, at first you'll have a bad time because you'll have to go to doctors, operating theaters ... but at age 5 or 6 when you see that your child starts to walk, to run, to go to school, Because you will see that it is overcome. Any dreams to come true? Now my project is to see if in the world day of rare diseases I can do some paper in Aranjuez, try to go to schools ... But my dream is to make a meeting in Aranjuez of Apert Syndrome.;0.14363876863876862;0.45173160173160165

The truth is that it has been a constant struggle, and today I am still the same, yes, going through a number of operations that I do not know if they served for something, although I like to think that yes, a long break of about 20 years In which no doctor gave me any solution or treatment. Even the name and all its symptoms I have known 8 years ago, because until that moment, what I suffered was an angioma without more. In 2005 I underwent an investigation at the University Clinic of Navarra and I still continue to go once a year although it is no longer research, and if before being a research grant was free, for 3 years I have to pay if I want them to keep seeing me And not be abandoned again. Needless to say, the money that they ask of me, I have to do virguerías to get it, so much so that I predict that this year I will have to stop attending and again go back to the nothing of social security.

It was a very difficult time in my life where fear reigned.

I was born again, and two years later I managed to get my back in my Brotherhood, something I thought I could never do. This same year, with almost 40, the disease has come back to remember me, hitting me again just a few days before Easter. If the first time I felt afraid ... this time the panic gripped me. Luckily this time has not become a quarter of what was the first time, but mentally the effects have been a thousand times worse. An endless sense of suffocation, anguish, and fragility took over my life, and I felt the impotence I felt so closely. I saw how my abilities were diminishing and I could do nothing to avoid it. I felt useless and misunderstood. At first they discarded that he had the disease again, and they sounded like ""anxiety crisis"" or ""nervous depression"". But I know my body well, and finally many tests and tests confirmed what I already knew. The disease was back. But far from despairing and sinking into it, I got up again, leaned on my wife and my two children to get ahead. They have been my pillars and along with my confidence and effort, I am back to overcome it. I have been two months of physiotherapy and medical treatment and every day I am stronger. And I know that next year I will be under the step again. With this testimony I intend to encourage those who, like me, have a rare disease. To leave such a situation requires many things, but sometimes we forget the importance of our attitude, our effort, and our desire to overcome difficulties. And our desire to LIVE. We should never give up. I hope I have helped to give strength to all those who need it.";0.057646780303030304;0.4697916666666666
Andrea;2;Spain;1;0;Gangliosidosis;0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Hello, in 2005 I was a father for the second time, I had a beautiful girl, ANDREA, a very sought after child, since we had a 5 year old and our joy was immense, I was 29 years old and my wife 27, without any problem , And a whole life to be able to enjoy our children, everything started to truncate when at 6 months, we began to notice that our daughter did not grow with the same development that had made our other son, doctors did not know why, a Private doctor only told us that he had a great delay and that we would fight hard for her, she did not fall the world over, I remember that day we hugged, we cried and all that perfect life was truncated in a minute, not knowing what yet We did not know, we started to fight, we visited up to 3 different hospitals, we spoke with the best doctors, we took our daughter to the best physio to work with her, until after many tests we were told that she had SANDHOF disease F, two cases in Spain and unfortunately the outcome would be the death of my daughter, that day I changed my life forever, we started a fight, ANDREA began a struggle to want to live, we enjoyed with her every moment, we did everything for her, trying That it was not true what they told us, I never heard her say it, but only a gesture, a smile, an apprehension with her hand was a happiness, a tenderness, inexplicable.

Anonymous3;33;Spain;1;0;Non-neuropathic heredofamilial amyloidosis;23;;;;0;;0;;;4;;;;;;0;;;;;;Good evening, I am 33 years old and 10 years ago I was diagnosed as suffering from family Mediterranean fever, which means that I have been medicated for 10 years but it has not really been until this week that my father has been tested for genetics and produced Of family Mediterranean fever in homozygosis, two years ago when they did it to me, they were inconclusive because none of my parents had been tested, I had the gene altered in heterozygosis. Today, my father has finally gone to the doctor and told his doctor that he can treat him. Although I have only been treated for 10 years, I have been ill for 23 years. The crises are getting worse. Low on two occasions because although it is inflamed and with fever I go to work. I am a strong person and I do not let anyone take pity on me and much less let me leave the disease, so I try to continue my normal life, I go to the gym from Monday to Sunday, my work from Monday to Friday And my university Monday and Wednesday, when the crises are accompanied by vomiting, I have to unsubscribe, but while it is not, I will continue with my life. I take a colchicine every day, I have it put for life, I can not stop taking it and also lower the dose because I fall. I'm going to do a genetic counseling, especially if I ever want to have children, they're going to test my brothers, they have to build a family tree, and apparently they'll reunite my father's brothers Which have symptoms) to treat or test. I want this to be an example for people who are sick, I know that you do not have quality of life, but you do not have to be regretting how much it hurts ... you have to keep busy so you do not think about what can happen, Because if not ... you do not live. With this, I would like if you have children who are sick, please make them strong and if the sick are you, do it for yourself. It is already known that this is a degenerative disease, has no cure and worse and worse crises (at least in my case), but that does not mean that you can be happy and make your life normal. A greeting.;-0.04832551707551707;0.5978615520282186
Anonymous4;;Spain;1;0;Other sphingolipidosis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2;;2;;;;;Having a low incidence illness means being a rare person, that health professionals often look at you with curiosity, people pity you and look at you with grief and the administration ignores you because there are no resources for people like that. I have Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (DML), a disease of rare hereditary metabolism. Mine is the only case in adults who are aware of this neurodegenerative disease for which there is currently no treatment. Getting to the diagnosis was very complicated and painful. My abilities diminished, I had difficulties first to study and later to work, problems of concentration, slowness to speak, difficulties in the march ... We went to many doctors. Some underestimated the problems and others attributed it to mental disorders so I was more than 20 years classified mentally ill and medicated for dozens of pathologies of this nature without any improvement in my state of health. A crisis of epilepsy that left me in a coma came to shed light on my situation. I received assistance at the Hospital of Mataró in Barcelona. There the doctors looked beyond, they were not confused by the confused diagnosis with which I arrived and I was diagnosed of DML. In only one day they had the suspicion and in three days, after practicing the opportune tests, the confirmation. This makes me continue to rely on the doctors I just ask not to get carried away by first impressions and try to go further, to listen to patients. The disease, in addition to the severe epilepsy crisis that I have suffered and that have endangered my life, has affected my cognitive ability. I have significant memory losses, difficulty expressing myself and problems in orienting myself in time and space. I need the continued support of a third person to perform my daily activities. The society and the health system are not prepared to attend a person of my characteristics. I need cognitive rehabilitation, train my brain and keep it active to prevent faster degeneration. It has not been easy to find such services, which are mainly targeted at elderly people with Alzheimer's. My family looked for a lot, was informed by all means within their reach and the lack of existing resources designed me a home stimulation program and from the ignorance of non-professionals. Finally, we accessed a pilot program at the Old Hospital of Mataró, based on a technological platform for cognitive rehabilitation. Again the program was not meant for me. It was not in the program because it was aimed at people with brain accidents. But I agreed thanks to my neurologist's commitment. Against all odds the result was positive, I improved, which encouraged us to continue looking after the program. Currently I am following a program in the Catalan Association of people suffering from traumatic brain injury and acquired brain damage (TRACE). I share many problems, characteristics and conditions with this type of people and in the entity have given me shelter despite not being a person affected by trauma. In my case, resources and aid always come from private initiative. The public system has no resources for me, they say they do not exist. The doctors who treat me have very good will, are considered, offer me all kinds of advice and help and support the actions that we carry out to maintain my state of health. But unfortunately they can not help me, there are no resources. In addition ignorance, due to the lack of precedent or referent, causes us to have important gaps or doubts about the future. And the crisis. The cuts in health carried out by the Government of the Generalitat de Catalunya have forced me to change my neurologist. The center where they treated me, where I was diagnosed with the disease, does not belong to me for reasons of residence, geography, and I had to change. I think that the administration should take more into account the needs of the patients and not treat us all with watertight templates, drawers in which you fit or do not fit. Because I do not fit in any. Life teaches us all to be flexible, to know that things are not white or black. But our leaders have not realized that there are people with special needs, that does not fit into the template that they have made, which they have designed in an office. I have a degree of severe dependence but I do not see any help from the so-called Dependency Law. I do not require physical help, physiotherapy, or help with hygiene. Then there is nothing. Just a help for the admission to a care center where I do not work in my maintenance, but in the park for a few hours. They assure me that there are no centers specialized in this type of diseases but I think so. In fact I am sure because I have visited them. Once again the bureaucracy. What I have learned most to value from my situation is the help that people give me in a disinterested way. Minor things that you did not pay attention to before. Phone calls from friends to know how I am, the smile of my yoga teacher when I do a good exercise, go out to eat a weekend with my family or the unconditional support of my environment, without detracting from my situation, He knows how to subtract importance to my problems and to make easier the difficulties with which I find myself day by day. I do not like people to pity me. I have different conditions to the others but we all have specific characteristics that make us unique and we each have to play with the cards we have. My life is not like that of others, like that of people my age, but I am happy. They say that what does not kill us makes us stronger and for me the DML has not killed me but it has made me stronger, much stronger to stand up, learn to live with her but watch and constantly threatening to win the game.;0.07953122220245505;0.448223230346518
Loli;;Spain;1;0;Myasthenia gravis;;;;0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;My name is Loli, I have Myasthenia Gravias, a rare disease. They spent three years giving me length, treating me crazy and sending me from doctor to doctor without giving my diagnosis. He was practically a dead man in life, he had hardly any strength in any muscle in my body, and the doctors kept telling me that they were fools of mine. I have been with Miastenia Gravis for almost 20 years, now I accept and respect it, I am not afraid of it, it is a complicated disease and difficult to diagnose as all neuromuscular diseases, but ours is also called the liar, apparently we are divine of death When in fact we can not move a muscle, I could be days describing my illness and nobody would understand it, just another person who had it, is not fatigue or fatigue, it is simply that I have no strength in my muscles but are plugged by a liquid Which my blood produces, and does not let the signal from the brain to the muscle, myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease. I have always felt very neglected by society, it does not treat us well, we are a collective apart from the media and our disease apart from being little known is still very difficult diagnosis, nor are neurologists diagnosed at the first consultation. I was three years in hell, really thinking I was crazy, I kept saying in a low voice that I could do it to see if I could move my body, but that was no use, for us to want is to be power is simply one More phrase In our case even if we want we can not do things, we can not even smile, our parasympathetic muscle is annulled by Myasthenia Gravis. The day that the neurologist told me the name of my illness I had no idea what it was, but I felt a great relief, finally put a name to what was taking my life, I could hardly take a step without lacking the air. When the neurologist explained to me what he had and what he had to do to extract the thymus that hypothetically was what infected my blood, I told him to do it to me as soon as possible without thinking, he told me that he was very brave, That I answered that if it took away the despair that I had I did not care the price of the pain for the operation that awaited me. Now I am an administrator of a group of myasthenia gravis on Facebook, it is called united by Myasthenia Gravis, I do not want anyone to go through the suffering that I experienced during those three years, I did not have any information about my illness. I am still ill, I will never be cured, but I will continue fighting for the rest of my life, for myself and for all people with myasthenia gravis.;0.01033950617283951;0.6344797178130511
Anonymous5;33;Spain;1;0;Benign intracranial hypertension;31;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;4;;;;"Hello everyone! I am 33 years old and 1 year and 11 months ago it all started for me. I had a normal life and whenever I saw people with a rare disease on TV I thought, ""How is that going to happen to me? It's impossible."" Well, it does happen and when you least expect it. One day I started a mild but constant headache that did not go away, even taking medication, until at 2 weeks, in the middle of a work meeting, I lost my right eye vision ... everything was blurry. I was scared, I went to the hospital and after a visual fundus and visual field tests (both with normal result ... without papilloedema) I was referred to the neurologist ... and that I thought that those who did not find anything was something good! There began the ordeal, a rosary of endless tests (analytic thousand, resonances, angiography, plates of thorax, etc ...) and various diagnoses, from Lyme disease, cranial tumor, sclerosis ... The most complicated day was when I was told that I would probably be totally blind in 3 years or that it might be an inoperable tumor. After 3 months of tests and a thousand variants of medication, they ruled out all possibilities. But it did not improve. I ended up getting into the hospital because insomnia because of the headache was unbearable (I slept a total of 3 hours in 3 days ... My head exploded). I felt strange when the doctor came to the emergency waiting room and told me that they had to enter me, which seemed a little serious. The people around me kept looking at me because, apparently, I was healthy and there were people with very serious appearance. I was hospitalized for 2 weeks. I was crammed with a thousand different types of pills, repeating all the previous tests and beginning with the lumbar punctures (Very painful! Why lie ... 8 punctures in less than 5 months ... In the first puncture, the intracranial pressure was of 41, they told me that the normal thing is 15. But after that puncture it seemed that the diagnosis was already clear ... benign intracranial hypertension, I did not know or pronounce it. They gave me a very technical explanation of what it was ... but summarizing it to a Understandable language is: cerebrospinal fluid excess caused by unknown cause, and the central nervous system being a closed circuit, presses the brain, optical nerves, etc ... hence the most visible symptom, in addition to headache, Is the loss of vision.I started with the famous edemox (what is seen, only medicine to treat the disease), 12 days + prednisone 60mg / day + lexatin 3mg / day + ibuprofen1200mg / day + etc ... In short. .. nail 22 pills daily and without much improvement ... that yes, at least I recovered the vision. But prednisone began to have side effects ... gave me a Cushing's syndrome yatorgenic (I could not believe that I had another disease unpronounceable and is over, caused by medication) and gained 30 kilos in a month, in addition to blood hypertension, Bestial fatigue, SUPER painful stretch marks that filled my whole body ... not normal ones, but big and deep, like huge scars that covered the chest, arms, abdomen, legs, etc ... But the headache was Worse and there was only relief after the lumbar punctures, it was immediate, but because of the corticosteroids, the obesity and the arterial hypertension that were provoking me, they could not even puncture me (the last puncture inside a huge machine were 21 punctures at one time WITHOUT being able to draw liquid ... Frustrating!). Neurologists contacted the neurosurgeon and decided to put a lumbo-peritoneal valve that inserted me on March 7, 2012 ... I bless that day! Just wake up from the anesthesia the headache was gone (after 9 months of horrible coexistence). Since the operation, everything has been improving ... The cushing syndrome that caused me steroids has disappeared a year later, I have lost more than 30 kilos and I still disagree, headaches only appear as those of any normal person and They leave right away! And I do not take the 22 pills a day (I do not take any) ... I finished edemox 9 months ago !! ... I do not know if the valve will be blocked in the future (apparently it is relatively normal for that to happen ), But I am optimistic and consider life differently. Yes, I have a rare disease ... Yes, I have to live with her and her symptoms ... Knowing that maybe someday disappears, or maybe not, but I will NOT let her control my life ... I have had a lot of support and I really encourage all those who suffer from this disease or the like to not be discouraged (even if they see everything black and without end) ... Self-esteem is fundamental so that your life does not come to you. But above all I thank the team of neurology and neurosurgery at Puerta de Hierro hospital for showing me (and continue to do) so much help and support. But I find it infuriating to find out a year after the doctor who saved my life (or at least that's my feeling), I probably end up unemployed within a month because there is no money in public health. Every time I go to a checkup and look at the patients who are there in the waiting room I think that because of the lack of funds, maybe they will not find a cure or at least a relief for their symptoms ... Outrageous and should not be allowed! Rare diseases, being a minority sector, are not on the list of health priorities, but are equally serious and these patients should have the same rights and opportunities as any other patient.";-0.010760809312638581;0.5107897793263645
Edu;30;Spain;1;0;Congenital malformation short stature;;;;;0;;0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Hello my name is Edu and I'm 30 years old. I have a rare condition called Prader Willi. It is a disorder of eating and behavior. I have a hard time controlling myself and people do not understand. At age 6 I went to special school Lexia was wrong because I had a principal who did not understand me and did not treat me well. He would hit me with a broom and I would cry. My mother changed my school. At 12 a.m. I went to Taiga special school, it was very nice but a teacher told me that she ignored me, and then I got angry and threw things on her like chairs, etc. My mother called the psychologist of the association prader willi to have a meeting to talk about if I can change class. When I finished school I went to Icaria, it is a special work center and a few days was very good but the psychologist Icaria changed and I was very sad my mother pulled out of there to go home. I wanted to work in a good place but it was difficult to find. Later I went to the Marquet Molins Center before it was very good but a teacher told me that I only do the things that I like and I do not do the things I do not like. And he told me that I only do what I want, I do not like being told that. I was always crying and she would not help me. My mother took me out of there to go home. Then I was very bad and my parents were looking for a house outside of Barcelona. So we went to live in Vallclara three years ago. My parents bought a dog for me named Poma and I was sick of the heart and died and I was broken and crying a lot. Then the boss of the store has given me a dog named Nina who is a beautiful bitch and is very good, she has helped me a lot to be calm. Now I am very well with my pet that I love her very much. In the morning I go to walk my dog ??with a lady called Isabel who has two dogs called Flor and Champi, we go the mountain and discover new roads. One day the flower was malia because it has eaten many bones and could not remove them I gave a syrup of my pet and he cured. When I get home breakfast and then I do my things on the computer. In the afternoon I like to play Parcheesi with my mother when she is not playing with my father. I also go to the movies, etc. In Vallclara I have found new friends and people who love me, like Mª José and Lola, who love them very much. For three months I work in a dog hairdresser, one day a week. I have a partner who treats me very well and his name is David. I really like that job everyone treat me well and the boss is a very good person. This job is very important to me. Thanks to my parents my life has changed a lot now I am very well, calm and happy. I do not get so angry anymore, I've learned to control myself better and I laugh a lot. My name is Milagros is very good and takes good care of me. I have an older brother named Albert and I love him very much. My father is a very good person and I love you very much. Thanks to my mother that I am well and happy to help me solve all my problems. And she is very handsome and a good person. My mother says that educators of the ordinary school, the special school and the special work centers do not have enough training on minority diseases and information is scarce. I want to take this opportunity to ask the people responsible for education to make action protocols so that educators know how to act in each case, taking into account each particular pathology. Now I am older and I do not go to school but I would like the teachers to treat the boys well with Prader Willi. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!;0.23035861162646876;0.5678815708101425
Anna;16;Spain;1;0;Dup15q;14;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0;;;"Anna poses before the camera. She is extroverted and ""has a prodigious memory"", says her mother, Angela. But Anna, despite being in full adolescence - is 16 years old - neither reads nor writes. It is one of the few people in Spain diagnosed with a rare disease known as the Dup15q syndrome, for which it has double the chromosome 15. It has a prevalence of one for every 30,000 born, although in Spain, since there are no records of rare diseases - The government approved last Friday its creation -, is not known with exactitude. Susana Boronat is an expert in Neuropediatrics at Vall d'Hebron Hospital in Barcelona and one of the few doctors who knows this disease well in our country, where there are only about 50 diagnosed cases. ""It is difficult to detect if concrete tests are not done in search of this duplicity because they are children who do not have any facial features that determine the problem, but they do add several symptoms such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, motor problems, learning .. But the key is that everyone develops epilepsy at some point. "" As happened to Anna, who at the beginning of her puberty, at age 14, gave her first attack and it was after this episode when, at last, they were diagnosed with the disease. Although the doctor affirms that there are no features on the face that reflect the chromatic abnormality, yes that can be perceived in the eyes. ""It depends on the day, and how you look at it, it has one color or another. They are unique, ""says Angela. However, that beauty that hides is the duplicity of the chromosome that Anna has. ""The different colors that are seen in your iris and that form a mosaic are nothing more than the network that is woven between healthy cells, with the darkest color, and the most affected, the clear ones. This contrast can also be seen on the skin, where white spots may appear, ""says the doctor. The truth is that it was through some spots Anna saw him as they managed to give his diagnosis. ""They did a biopsy and determined that a genetic study had to be done. It was there that they discovered that they had a duplicate chromosome. But not all families will do this test. That is why the 15Q Chromosome Reversal Investment Foundation, made up of affected families, is trying to fund a project in the Ciberer (Center for Biomedical Research in the Network of Rare Diseases) so that hidden cases can be detected in Spain, since only This result is reached through the genetic test because when you have a diagnosis, you can perform a more specific surveillance and care. Working for the best drug, ""says the doctor. ""Although we are very far from finding a cure. There is only one working group at the international level working in this area and it has been formed by a Boston doctor whose son has the disease and seeks to ""better know what part of the chromosome works well. Anna, thanks to the delay in her first epilepsy attack leads a normal life. He plays basketball, he does not miss a day in his swimming class and he loves to dance to the rhythm of Bollywood songs. But not all children are so lucky. Ishmael is one of them. He is three and a half years old and his illness is forcing him to spend too many days in the hospital. His birth was complicated because his mother, Isabel, had to have a cesarean section and early delivery. ""He did not move much. He was born with hypoglycemia and had to be admitted to the ICU for 23 days », but after this period he was able to return home. ""They only told me that they had detected two murmurs in his heart."" The months passed and they saw that Ishmael never raised his arms and ""his neurologist told us he was late, but he did not know the cause."" As Dr. Boronat explains, ""most children are diagnosed with some kind of disability, but they do not know how to determine their origin."" It was a year when, through an encephalogram, they saw that ""he had a type of secondary epilepsy, refractory and that can not be treated with any medication,"" explains his mother. ""That these crises appear when they are still so small is what causes the most problems and is difficult to tackle. They affect their development, ""adds the specialist in Neuropediatrics. ""From there, everything has been an ordeal. He has entered a thousand and one times for different problems: respiratory, fevers with epileptic decompensation ... Until this year he has also had pneumonia. Isabel tells the story of her little boy from the hospital room in which he is still hospitalized. ""In July they had to do a tracheotomy that became complicated and resulted in a pneumothorax."" At that moment, he explains with anguish, ""he almost dies, but he is very strong and has managed to leave, although now he has a nasogastric tube because doctors believe that not coordinating what he swallows, he goes to the lung."" It was only a few months ago when they did a genetic test, known as an array, and the results determined that it had a duplication of chromosome 15, ""but they are waiting to confirm it because now it will start to value a different neurologist, Alicante ». This is one of the complaints of the relatives and Dr. Boronat, who insist that as there is no reference center to which all can go, regardless of the autonomous community in which they live, diagnosis and treatment is much more difficult. The little Ishmael does not walk, does not feel alone, has very weak bodybuilding, but Isabel only hopes that after the operation that has passed last November 20, ""can lead a dignified life. Go to school, even with a pipe around your neck. And that, in a future, everything can be removed. The little boy, despite everything, smiles, ""feels like living, but we realize that doctors are very lost with the treatment.";0.08294105437941056;0.5112899543378996
Miriam;23;Spain;1;0;Congenital malformation syndromes predominantly affecting facial appearance;17;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;This is Miriam. She is now 23 years old. At age 17, she was diagnosed with Stickler Syndrome, with a mutation in the COL2A1 gene. She is a strong woman, full of energy, of those people who have large eyes that speak alone, that convey affection and vitality. Miriam tells us how she lives her reality, how she confronts her every day. It is a lesson for all of us. A lesson on how to live and face the day to day. Thanks Miriam for sharing !! Today Greta and I have not fought ... she has promised me a truce, and I have thanked her as always, promising her that I would behave well and that I would make an effort not to go to the port today, and she knows that for me Promise him not to go to my place of peace today ... I must be speaking to him seriously. This morning I almost got something when I went out on the street, the cold has not warned me that it is already here and I have left barely sheltered from home. I had to go back up and there they were on the ledge, right where I left them last night, my hearing aids, and I smile, as I like to wear them and turn them off when I want to get away from the world, either on the train at 7:15 In the morning, or in some celebration of the victory of some equipment that I do not like, or when I go to the library to study, I confess it, if sometimes I cheat against the world ... and I love it. The thing is ... I lied to Greta today and she scolded me for it. Just arriving from the station I decided to go to the port by the promenade. Why the port? When I found out I had Stickler Syndrome, I was only 17 years old. I remember perfectly that day, I remember him from time to time, especially when some brave man asks me what I felt that day. At first I laughed, and looked around the hospital room. I knew both my doctor and my parents were watching me, but I kept scanning the room for some camera that made me understand that this was just a heavy joke. I did not find it, and suddenly I stopped being amused and started to cry. Crying, something that sometimes people, we define as the reaction to a sad or traumatic event. No, ladies and gentlemen, crying is also a product of relief. I was relieving myself, until I could no more. I remember that we got home and had some SMS on my cell phone but I turned it off and I locked myself in my room, I just went out for dinner. I was like this for a few days, absent, going, assimilating, asking myself, consoling me, for I did not say anything to anyone. On Saturday of that week I went to walk alone, ignoring the insistence of my family or friends, to talk about what happened. And when I wanted to realize, I was already there, in the port. And I fell in love, it was a crush. Peace was breathed, a lot of peace, and the sweet sound of the waves coming and going as they crashed against the rocks. And for the first time, I stopped feeling that knot in my stomach, I realized that the world had not stopped just because I had a rare disease, that it was still me. Since then I have been able to talk about the subject with mine, in small pieces, gently, without pressure. Yes, I had a hard time accepting it. Yes, it is not tasteful dish. Yes, you feel different. And yes, there are hard days. But how much is that next to memories like: the five thousand times my friends have reminded me that I'm dumb because I think I'm a weirdo, the five thousand times that nobody has cared about losing a train just because I do not I could run, or the thousand times my friends gave me a lesson, they whispered to me to put on the devices and leave my complexes, or that time when someone I met a long time ago told me that my scars were precious taking away My complexes, and I could go on and on and on. But it all boils down to one word, LOVE, of all types and forms. My name is Miriam, I am 23 years old and I suffer from a syndrome called Stickler. I love theater, cinema, literature. I live constantly surrounded by small children. I have a family that adores me and although sometimes it is a little dry, I have some wonderful friends who want me crazy. Most limping days, a symptom of fatigue, but I do not worry, at least not now, I have learned to talk with my limp to take care of him. And it does not matter if I limp, if I wear appliances in my ears or if I have to go to the doctor a thousand times a month. That's not what defines me, what defines me is that even though I have everything, I keep smiling, I keep getting up every morning thinking about what I want and what I do not. I have long since stopped reproaching myself for having a disease. Because either I get up, or no one will do it for me. So if you're there, if you're reading me, I want you to know that no matter how you are, or whatever you have, not even how you got here, to read me. Do not doubt that the only enemy you have is you. Greta, my leg, sends you greetings and encouragement.;0.08846930846930845;0.5040231990231988
Marta;21;Spain;1;0;Congenital malformation syndromes predominantly affecting facial appearance;0;Several operations;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0;;;;0;;"My name is Marta Santodomingo, I am 21 years old, I live in Girona (Spain) and I am affected by Moebius Syndrome. I am the youngest of three brothers and have managed to raise me normally, without being ashamed of me giving me confidence and freedom. Since my birth, my parents saw that my face had no expression and I was the first month in the ICU. When I was diagnosed with Moebius Syndrome, my family started the fight with me. I have done speech therapy, at 18 months I had a strabismus operation. It is very important that from the first year to seven years, the work is constant, because all the effort you make, until this moment, will be seen in the future results. Thanks to my family, it is what I am now; For his constant struggle with me since the day I was born, which has not been easy for them, for never giving up and for continuing to struggle for a better quality of life. From the age of six I play the violin, and at the age of twelve I began to learn the piano. First I chose the violin because I liked it and also because it was stimulating the side of the face. But at the age of twelve I wanted to try the piano, since it was also another of my favorite instruments. The violin I love, but the piano fascinates me! I have also been part of an orchestra ""Jove Orquestra del Gironès"". This year I am attending nursing assistant. I do the same as any other girl who is 21 years old: I like to go out, listen to music, go to the movies, I love to travel. My friends accept me as I am, that's why we are friends. I have always said and I have been clear that it is RARE DISEASE, NOT THE PERSON! I have gone through 5 operations and in a few months I will continue to operate as a maxillofacial. The deepest thought is ""why it has touched me to have Moebius Syndrome""? The person who has lost a physical or psychic faculty, by accident or illness, in a period of his life, may notice the lack of what he was previously, but he has been able to live in all his faculties until the day he has lost one. I do not know what it is to lose my facial and visual mobility since I have never had it, but I am aware that together with my family and with my personal effort I am struggling to overcome all obstacles that I may encounter. I think that even if you have a disease or a syndrome, life you have to live and enjoy it, you do not know when the end of your life will be. That is why I live it like any other: I am normal and I live the syndrome naturally, as a characteristic that is part of me, when something can not be changed, it has to accept it. There is no more, I can not go back to the womb and redo the path. I hope my story, help all the relatives of Moebius Syndrome to be strong and fight hard but above all and most importantly, is to live life and not stay at home, because shut up at home does not give you life! Disability has no limits, you put them yourself. Do not say I CAN NOT, but, IF I can do everything that I propose. Life must be lived and loved in spite of the difficulties or conditions of life that a person may have. Do not ever give up, you always have to pull forward looking at life in a positive way. There are times that life gives you such a sharp turn that it does not give you time to react to that thing that has just happened to you. You think, why me? Why my son? Well, all you can do is fight, fight for a future or better quality of life. You have to be supportive; Support and help other diseases / causes, because we are human and because in the end we are united in our differences. UNION MAKE FORCE!!! That is why I have also created this blog, a space mine and for everyone, where also affected and family can share their story. Besides this blog is not only affected by Moebius Syndrome, but, for anyone who wants to participate, ie, narrating from outside; How you see children / adults with Moebius, experiences you've had with them. Be proud of being the way you are. Feel lucky to be here and now. Life is a continuous struggle, but raise your head and breathe. Everything will be fine! I hope you accompany me on this project!";0.17910798559364136;0.44734937193953594
Anonymous6;24;Spain;1;0;Algoneurodystrophy;22;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;4;"Hello, I am a 24 year old girl, and today I would like to tell you my story regarding a clinical case that, so far, many of the hands that I have passed have described it as: ""your case is very rare"" or ""I've never seen anything like it in the years I've been working."" How did it all begin? On November 21, 2015 I was walking and without giving a famous ""bad step"" or twist, I went with normal shoes without heels, gave me a pain that I described as ""a pain from the heel to the very strong ankle."" Let me tell you what has been the course of my pain ... First I went to the emergency room and I immobilized the foot for a week and a half, where the first diagnosis was: sprain with tendinitis. When I went to remove the band I said I could walk, but nevertheless sent me a resonance to see if there was anything else. I tried to walk and it was impossible, they performed the resonance and I saw a senovial cyst on the opposite side of where I got my pain, so it was not the cause of it. As it was impossible for me to walk, my way of moving was with crutches and my left foot (without supporting anything the right cause of the pain) or with the wheelchair for the street, since my left foot is resenting to overload it. Then my primary care physician referred me to the emergency room twice, the first of which empirically infiltrated me to see if it was the Tarsus Sinus Syndrome. The second time the doctor who saw me sent me a plantar x-ray. The results did not show any bad diagnosis, everything was correct. This day I wanted to immobilize the entire leg and I refused to lose muscle mass or mobility within my situation. I also performed an electromyogram and in this test my results were normal. I wanted them to send me a bone scan but they told me it was not necessary, so we considered a second opinion and decided to go to another clinic. At this clinic without me asking for it, they sent me a bone scintigraphy. My family and I took a load off when discarding tumors, but the uncertainty of what could be was still there. From this moment traumatology led me to the unity of pain. The doctor who saw me told me that I had neuropathic pain or that it was the beginning of Sudeck Syndrome, and to begin treatment it should take medication and rehabilitation treatment. The final diagnosis was Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy, they sent me in the pain unit a first medication but I had tried it a few weeks ago and I did not tolerate it, so I was sent to another type of treatment. Symptoms During the day it is like an ice cube and at night it swells and it makes me burn, and with the changes of purple temperature. So far I've gone through several stages with regard to my foot in all these months: At first I did not change color or temperature. After a month I started with changes. When the crises of pain gave me my foot was hot, with very marked veins and very red and swollen. After 3 months change the foot began to be very very cold and with coloration pulling purple, and it changes to warm in less occasions although the crises of pain continue (they even give to me more frequently), but it does not get so hot. And when I do contrast baths or just in the shower my foot turns very purple. Further struggles? I have recently had a lumbar blockade of the sympathetic system, and I have to wait and see how my foot reacts, although it still hurts me a lot ... Keep fighting to get back on track since I've been in a wheelchair since November.";0.07963293650793653;0.5047371031746034
